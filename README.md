LinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/kondwani-kamundi-771517159/

> In case you're wondering why my contributions on this account only date back to 2022 — my original GitHub account was compromised for a while. Although I eventually recovered it, I had already created this new account for work purposes and decided to stick with it. You can view [a snapshot of my previous profile here](https://1drv.ms/i/c/c79cff9e1cc5d2f4/EZmwXXtIUg5Jgsy7Fg6s0aYBPo51vKNBydSPPJ0uWcgBRg?e=rQh1rb) for reference. My coding Journey started in 2015.

## About Me  
I'm a **Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer** with 6+ years of experience in software development and system design. My passion lies in using technology to solve real-world challenges, like improving education outcomes for underserved communities.

- Previously led development at **IBL AI** ([ibl.ai](https://ibl.ai/)), building AI-driven skills platforms used by **ACI Learning, Nvidia, Evermode, and Legatum**.

## 🧠 Soft Skills

**🛠 Responsibility**  
Sometimes things go wrong—when they do, I take responsibility and learn from it.

**🏢 Ownership**  
It’s never *your* thing, *your* company—it’s *ours*. That means I show up like it matters, because it does.

**💙 Caring**  
At the end of the day, people matter. I try to never lose sight of that.

**💬 Communication**  
I’m married—of course I had to learn to communicate 😄

**🤝 Honesty & Integrity**  
It’s never easy to say the deadline’s too tight. But I’d rather be honest than overpromise.

**🔄 Adaptability**  
We’re never perfect, so being adaptable is our best shot at getting there.

**🌟 Positive Attitude**  
My name *Kondwani* means “happy”—and yes, I definitely bring the vibes.

**🧩 Problem Solving**  
This one’s rooted in my belief system. It’s personal, but here’s the gist: I believe I can. Therefore, I will.

**💼 Work Ethic**  
I pick work that aligns with my purpose—when it does, putting in the effort feels natural.

**🌻 Always Learning**  
I definitely don’t know everything—no one does. But I’m wired to stay curious, ask questions, and keep growing. Currently diving deep into a BSc in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.iu.org/bachelors/applied-artificial-intelligence/on-campus/)—because why not learn how to build the future?


Let me know if you want it with a different kind of vibe!
