# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Kondwani Kamundi

> In case you're wondering why my contributions on this account only date back to 2022 â€” my original GitHub account was compromised for a while. Although I eventually recovered it, I had already created this new account for work purposes and decided to stick with it. You can view [a snapshot of my previous profile here](https://1drv.ms/i/c/c79cff9e1cc5d2f4/EZmwXXtIUg5Jgsy7Fg6s0aYBPo51vKNBydSPPJ0uWcgBRg?e=rQh1rb) for reference. My coding Journey started in 2015.

## About Me  
I'm a **Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer** with 6+ years of experience in software development and system design. Currently, I'm building **VirtuEducate**, an AI-powered exam prep assistant helping Malawian students prepare for **JCE and MSCE** exams. My passion lies in using technology to solve real world problems.

- Previously led development at **IBL AI** ([ibl.ai](https://ibl.ai/)), building AI-driven skills platforms used by **ACI Learning, Nvidia, Evermode, and Legatum**.
