## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with a strong **backend focus** and full-stack delivery experience. Over the past **6+ years**, I’ve designed scalable systems, built robust APIs, and contributed across the stack — from backend logic to frontend components — depending on the team’s needs.

- Former Lead Engineer at **[IBL AI](https://ibl.ai/)**, where I built AI-driven learning platforms used by **ACI Learning, Nvidia, Evermode**, and **Legatum**.
- Passionate about building purposeful tech — currently tackling education inequality through AI with my project **VirtuEducate**.

> 💡 Started my coding journey in **2015**

## 💡 Soft Skills

I bring more than just code to the table:

| Skill              | What it means to me |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 🛠 **Responsibility** | Sometimes things go wrong—when they do, I take responsibility and learn from it. |
| 🏢 **Ownership** | It’s never *your* thing, *your* company—it’s *ours*. That means I show up like it matters, because it does. |
| 💙 **Caring** | At the end of the day, people matter. I try to never lose sight of that. |
| 💬 **Communication** | I’m married—of course I had to learn to communicate 😄 |
| 🤝 **Honesty & Integrity** | It’s never easy to say the deadline’s too tight. But I’d rather be honest than overpromise. |
| 🔄 **Adaptability** | We’re never perfect, so being adaptable is our best shot at getting there. |
| 🌟 **Positive Attitude** | My name *Kondwani* means “happy”—and yes, I definitely bring the vibes. |
| 🧩 **Problem Solving** | This one’s rooted in my belief system. It’s personal, but here’s the gist: I believe I can. Therefore, I will. |
| 💼 **Work Ethic** | I pick work that aligns with my purpose—when it does, putting in the effort feels natural. |
| 🌻 **Always Learning** | I definitely don’t know everything—no one does. But I’m wired to stay curious, ask questions, and keep growing. Currently diving deep into a BSc in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.iu.org/bachelors/applied-artificial-intelligence/on-campus/)—because why not learn how to build the future? |
